### Credits
Project was originally developed by [ToastyTheToaster](https://github.com/toastythetoaster/SuperiorChat) an Ex Staff member who used the code from [ReduxRedstone](https://github.com/ReduxRedston). I ([JTG-Greaves](https://github.com/jtg-greaves)) has decided to continue this trend and have made significant improvements transforming it from just a chat based client to a staff tool.
